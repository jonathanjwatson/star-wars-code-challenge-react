## Star Wars Code Challenge - React

> This single page application uses React to query the OMDB database and display search results on the page. 

> Once a user clicks on a title, an additional API call is made via Axios to gather additional data for the selected film.

> A user can then add a movie to his/her favorites and view those favorites by selecting the button. 

### Back-end Notes

- Fixed initial code for functionality.
- Added comments for server routes.
- Setup port variable to handle Heroku deployment. 
- Added React-handling for Build directory.
- Added package.json scripts

### Front-end Notes

- Create-React-App was used to streamline the creation process. 
- react-router-dom used to handle second view for Favorites route. 
- Stateful components were used in all instances, but could later be refactored to stateless.
